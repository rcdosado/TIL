# interesting German words for english speakers

summarized from https://theconversation.com/why-the-german-language-has-so-many-great-words-55554

1. Backpfeifengesicht. It’s a combination of two nouns: Backpfeife (a slap across the cheek) and Gesicht (face). Together they indicate “a face that invites a slap.” (Cytowic calls it “a face in need of a good punch” – close enough.)
2. Weltschmerz (world-weariness)
3. Zeitgeist (spirit of the time)
4. Blitzkrieg (lightning war)
5. Gedankenexperiment (thought experiment).
6. Sitzpinkler: “a man who pees sitting down.” The noun is a compound of Sitz (“seat”), pinkeln (“to pee”), and -er (a male-specific suffix).
7. Abschiedsheuler (“a man who wails at farewells”)
8. Sockenfalter (“a man who folds his socks”).
9. Schadenfreude (“joy in another’s misfortune”). The contrast between the “damage” or “hurt” of the determiner (Schaden) with the primary “joy” (Freude) adds an ironic dimension to the already rich combination.
10. Verschlimmbesserung. verschlimmern (“to worsen”) and verbessern (“to improve”). It then conflates their prefixes (ver-), and adds the suffix (-ung) to turn it into a noun. This process compresses an idea that only a wordy English translation can unpack: “an intended improvement that makes things worse.”
11. das Werdende. It began with the verb werden (“to become”), but a couple of manipulations result in a relatively pithy noun that requires a mouthful when translated to English: “that which is in the process of becoming.”
12. eine Trittbrettunsterblichkeit.This coinage is made up of a number of separate elements: der Tritt (“step”) and das Brett ("board”), which combine to fashion das Trittbrett (“running board,” the footboard that runs along the side of certain trucks and antique cars). German usage has given this word a metaphorical connotation: “hanging on” or “freeloading.”
13. Trittbrettunsterblichkeit is “an immortality that is achieved by riding on someone’s coattails.”
