# How to create custom template tags

TIL how to create custom template tags, this allows you to create a function that you can
simply insert in a template html, for example you want to simple display the count of posts you have in your blog
this can be achieved simply by using tags, i just followed the Django Documentation, as it did not
work at first, but i just need to reload the server, for it to work, i suspect the cache is the culprit.

anyways, no need to reinvent the wheel, here is the link of how to do this
